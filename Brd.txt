* **Project Name:** Real-time Fraudulent Transaction Detection
* **Project Goal:** To implement a real-time system capable of detecting fraudulent financial
transactions using Kafka as the messaging backbone.
* **Project Scope:** The system will process transaction data, apply fraud detection algorithms,
and generate alerts for suspicious activities.
**1.2 Business Objectives**
* **Reduce financial losses:** Minimize losses due to fraudulent transactions.
* **Improve customer satisfaction:** Enhance customer trust and confidence by proactively
addressing fraudulent activities.
* **Comply with regulations:** Adhere to industry and regulatory standards related to fraud
prevention.
### **2. Business Context**
**2.1 Current Situation**
* Describe the existing processes and challenges in fraud detection.
* Identify the limitations of current systems and their impact on the business.
**2.2 Business Goals**
* Outline the desired outcomes and benefits of the project.
* Quantify the expected improvements in terms of financial savings, operational efficiency, and
risk mitigation.
### **3. Business Requirements**
**3.1 Functional Requirements**
* **Data Ingestion:**
* Ability to ingest transaction data from various sources (e.g., POS systems, online gateways,
mobile apps).
* Real-time data processing to ensure timely detection.
* **Fraud Detection:**
* Implementation of appropriate fraud detection algorithms (e.g., rule-based, machine
learning, anomaly detection).
* Configurability of fraud detection models to adapt to evolving fraud patterns.
* **Alert Generation:**
* Real-time generation of alerts for suspicious transactions.
* Integration with existing alert systems or notification channels.

* **Reporting and Analytics:**
    * Ability to generate reports on fraud trends, detection rates, and false positive/negative rates.
    * Integration with business intelligence tools for data analysis.

**3.2 Non-Functional Requirements**
* **Performance:**
    * Low latency for real-time processing.
    * Scalability to handle increasing transaction volumes.
* **Reliability:**
    * High availability and fault tolerance.
    * Data integrity and consistency.
* **Security:**
    * Data privacy and protection measures.
    * Compliance with relevant security standards (e.g., PCI DSS).
